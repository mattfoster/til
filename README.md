# TIL: Today I Learned/Tools I'd Liketosharpen

This repo should contain notes and todos for tool sharpening and TILs.

## Motivation

I need to think about implementing a system which lets me quickly and easily record stuff I've learnt and stuff I want to improve on.

Thoughtbot has a [repo](https://github.com/thoughtbot/til
) called TIL, in which various bits of useful info are stored as markdown files.

And then there's [this](https://github.com/thoughtbot/til/blob/master/vim/custom-command.md
) custom vim command which opens a markdown file.

But, I want something easy to use on different boxes,  without having to worry about clobbering notes, so perhaps I want different files. Maybe my custom command should open a new MD file in a git repo which auto-pushes to my VPS?

I think something which automatically makes a list of new stuff would be fun too, maybe with tags.

Would this also work with 'tool sharpening' ideas? I saw a peepcode screencast where someone had a file in dropbox in which they listed stuff that they wanted to make faster. I want to emulate this.
